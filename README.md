Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for building Android applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developing, debugging, and testing Android applications. Basic knowledge about Android app development includes knowledge about Java programming language, understanding of the Android architecture, and familiarity with different components of Android, such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers. With these prerequisites, developers can create engaging Android applications that meet the needs of their users.

> How to Build this Project?

> To build this project, the first step is to either clone the project from the repository or download the zip file and extract it. Once done, the project needs to be opened in Android Studio. The IDE will then start downloading the required files and dependencies. After the downloads are complete, the project can be built by clicking on the "Build" option in the Android Studio toolbar. Once built, the APK file can be installed and opened on an Android device. To log in, the user needs to use the Admin's credentials, which are "admin" for the username and "admin" for the password.
